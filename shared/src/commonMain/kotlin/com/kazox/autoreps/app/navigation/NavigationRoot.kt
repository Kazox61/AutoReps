/**
 * Tab switches swap on the spot: the tapped tab is simply there, which is what makes the bottom
 * bar feel responsive. Attached as metadata on the three tab-root entries so it outranks
 * NavDisplay's specs (nav3 priority: transitioning entry metadata > scene metadata > NavDisplay
 * defaults). Screens pushed inside a tab — Record, AddEditWorkout — carry no metadata, so they
 * keep the animated transitions, including when popping back to the tab root: a pop reads the
 * *leaving* screen's metadata, and that screen is the pushed one, not the tab root.
